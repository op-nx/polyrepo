# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** `nx graph` displays projects from all assembled repos with cross-repo dependency edges, and all relevant Nx CLI commands output projects from multiple repos
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Plugin Foundation + Repo Assembly

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase coarse structure derived from 3 requirement categories (ASSM, GRPH, GITX). Cross-repo deps and sync generators deferred to v2.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 (Git DX) depends on Phase 1 only, not Phase 2, since git operations need assembled repos but not the project graph.
- [Architecture]: Phase 2 graph integration must shell out to `nx show projects --json` / `nx graph --file=output.json` inside each repo workspace -- not manually walk project.json files. Each repo is a full Nx workspace with its own plugins and inferred targets. The "external tool" in the established Nx plugin pattern (gradle/maven/dotnet) is Nx itself.
